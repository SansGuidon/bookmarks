As an imperfect creature, I commit mistakes, and I also try to avoid them. Here are a regular ones, I hope to not repeat them, but it seems it's hard to learn your lessons sometimes...

# Git
* Always double check the text of your commit message, before, during, and after pushing it.
* Always double check the diff of your commit, before the commit, and after pushing it, that way you make sure you didn't cause a mess for later.

# Writing and Communication
* Always double check your texts via grammer checking tool before sending important communication. 
* Always double check the message you are answering to, before making conclusions or reacting in a hurry.
* Always double check the spelling of the name of whoever you discuss with before mentioning them so you don't offend them. 
* Always re-read everything you're about to send
* Don't misinterpret other's emotions and feelings based on your own mood 
* Stay factual don't jump to conclusions
* Double check your sources. Mention your references when quoting a number or text or reusing some idea / work / conclusion.
* Keep it simple.
* First say thank you when people are trying to help you, ask you something, or suggest you something. People take from their limited time for you, don't neglect that.
* Say when you're new to something or lack knowledge. Show your weaknesses and stay humble. Sometimes it can really makes a world of difference and even bring you opportunities / gifts. E.g : some shops will give you some extra for your first visit, especially if your toddler is cute and with you :-) 
* Pause and pace your speech
* Maintain good posture
* Be clear about what you ask, and give context.

# Helping
* Don't propose solutions/help too early especially if not asked. Many people prefer also to learn and solve problems by themselves.
* Let it burn. Sometimes that's the best you can do. Don't try to extinct every fire. Focus your energy on the problems that really impact you. There are enough solutions and people for the other problems and you don't have time for them all.
* Do the chores, act to help so others don't have to do everything
* Family first, work last 

# Reading
* Read it twice if you don't get it. Google it if you still don't get it. Try to understand what you're reading before moving to the next thing.
* Don't keep more than you can read in the next 4 weeks on your Kindle

# Caring & focus
* Don't multitask, don't multitask, don't multitask.... 
* But allow yourself to optimize the use of your time
* Family first, work last 
* Protect your time
* You won't have more time later, so avoid collections of "to do" or "to watch/listen" lists.
* Don't use any read-it later app
* Don't keep big todo lists
* Don't keep more than you can read in the next 4 weeks on your Kindle
