  * Don’t even start considering solutions until you **Understand** the problem. Your goal should be to “solve” the problem mostly within the problem domain, not the solution domain.
  * **eNumerate** multiple candidate solutions. Don’t just start prodding at your favorite!
  * Consider a candidate solution, then read the **Paper** if there is one.
  * Determine the **Historical context** in which the candidate solution was designed or developed.
  * Weigh **Advantages** against disadvantages. Determine what was de-prioritized to achieve what was prioritized.
  * **Think!** Soberly and humbly ponder how well this solution fits your problem. What fact would need to be different for you to change your mind? For instance, how much smaller would the data need to be before you’d elect not to use Hadoop?

* The Art Of Clean Code by [Victor Rentea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4OIo4T7I_E)
  * Make it more readable even if it makes writing harder : We read 10x more times than we write
  * Boy scout rule : always check in code cleaner than you found it
  * Functions are verbs
  * Boolean names should always answer yes/no
  * Classes are nouns. Avoid meaningless names (OrderInfo, OrderData vs Order)
  * Delete the interfaces : except for Remoting/API client jars and strategy pattern implementation.
  * Names : Make the name speak for itself. Apply Continuous renaming as your learn the application
  * Names : Names should be at least pronounceable. Don't abbreviate ! Unless it's a basic business concept, like VAT
  * Names : should be consistent and unique (synonyms confuse). 
  * Names should have meaningful context. eg: order.customerFirstName. But don't repeat yourself (DRY) : Order.~~order~~CreationDate
  * Functions should be small : 5-10 lines, ... or at least should be understandable in 5 sec no more.
  * Functions do one thing
  * Functions have max 2-3 parameters
* [Shirky Principle](https://twitter.com/OlafLewitz/statuses/560711454434025472) : Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution.

## personal thoughts
* [MorganGeek](https://twitter.com/MorganGeek/statuses/420907517934178304) - Problem solving / Productivity : Good programmers write code after they found the solution. Un bon programmeur ne commence à coder qu'après avoir trouvé une solution.
* [MorganGeek](https://twitter.com/MorganGeek/statuses/450614047608934400) - Productivity : To find a solution, first eliminate the impossible ones. Astuce : Trouver la solution en éliminant d'abord les non solutions.
* [MorganGeek](https://twitter.com/MorganGeek/statuses/450218285129531392) - Readability / Reusability : If you wan write a 100 lines function, you can also replace it with a dozen more legible functions
