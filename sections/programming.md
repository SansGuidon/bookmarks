> - On the other hand, lets say that instead we first come up with a clear overarching plan for what we’re doing. This makes it much more likely the outcome will be coherent. But the price we pay is having to handle the complexity of the entire challenge all at once.

> * You are moving too fast. Overwhelmed with everything, good or bad, happening around.
> * Life is too short (really) to zoom past it.
> * People who survive (and grow) are the ones who stay in the moment, concentrate and strive to deliver their best.
> * Quality never comes from rushing through things.
> * Just because you can do so many things doesn’t mean you should attempt all of them.
> * Rushing too fast through these is a risk, it is a killer. You never savor the moment, be in the present and enjoy the process. You end up ‘doing’ so much that there is no time to ‘ruminate’
* [Jason Fried](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes) - (2012) Give it five minutes
> * The faster you react, the less you think. Not always, but often.
> * It’s fine to disagree, it’s fine to push back, it’s great to have strong opinions and beliefs, but give my ideas some time to set in before you’re sure you want to argue against them.
> * There’s also a difference between asking questions and pushing back. Pushing back means you already think you know. Asking questions means you want to know. Ask more questions.
> * So next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a little bit before pushing back, before saying it’s too hard or it’s too much work. Those things may be true, but there may be another truth in there too: It may be worth it.
* [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2018/11/quality-and-effort/) - (2018) Quality and effort
> * We need to put care into our systems. We need to build checklists and peer review and resilience into the way we express our carefulness.
> * It seems ridiculous that a surgeon needs to write her name (with a Sharpie) on the limb that she’s about to operate on, but this simple system adjustment means that errors involving working on the wrong limb will go to zero.
> * Instead of reacting to an error with, “I need to be more careful,” we can respond with, “I can build a better system.”
> * If it matters enough to be careful, it matters enough to build a system around it.
> * **See also** [Martin Fowler's tweet](https://twitter.com/martinfowler/status/1057971818768818177) - "Don't teach people to be careful, instead get them to build systems that resist faults"

> * Focus on results; not time : Time tracking is unavoidable in some instances, but rather than the rule by which companies operate, it should be used as a secondary metric to the results they achieve. Rather than give an employee a 2-hour window to do a job, have her do it right the first time (bonus points for documenting the process), then review and adjust your future plans based on time tracking data.
> * Improve systems : Improving systems helps remove busywork from an employee’s day, but it also makes things easier for the customer. 
> * Whether you’re getting a lot of satisfaction from being busy or just feeling exasperated, don’t forget to occasionally stop and ask yourself: Is this the best use of time?

> Egoless programming is a concept introduced by Gerald Weinberg in The Psychology Of Computer Programming. The idea is that programmers must fight the natural tendency to treat their programs as part of themselves, and therefore to reject all criticism. Rather, they should do their best to treat their designs & implementations as objects independent of themselves, and to view criticism dispassionately on its merits.

> * Prioritize Clarity : The first step to writing clear code is to make it a priority.
> * Develop a sense for clarity : requires knowing what clear code looks like.
> * Edit : Reading back over what you just wrote will help give ideas for how to improve it.
> * Start by explaining : start by explaining what needs to be done as though you are telling it to another person (or rubber duck). Write it down. Take that explanation and transform it into code.
> * Comments : Code can’t self-document if it isn’t there. If you decide to not write some code and don’t leave a comment explaining why, there will be nothing left to explain what you were thinking!
> * Don’t mix levels : Mixing levels of abstraction makes the reader jump between thinking about what is being done and how it is implemented.
> * Break out functions | :duck: self-comment here : It's true to some extent, but breaking a code in too many functions can also force jumping a lot between code locations. So I would say it depends on the semantic and scope distance between those functions. 
> * Don’t break out functions : DRY starts to go too far when two functions that happen to share a handful of lines become a target for deduplication. The test for whether some pieces of code should be deduplicated is simple: would anything bad happen if one was changed without also changing the other? If the answer is yes, then make a single source of truth for it. If not, consider leaving it alone. | :duck: self-comment : exactly... what I just wrote above :-) 
> * Avoid configurable functions : Prefer many functions to a few, configurable functions, i.e It’s much better to have multiple functions, each of which does just one thing.
> * Don’t prematurely optimize

* [Semver check](https://jubianchi.github.io/semver-check/#/) - More and more projects try to follow Semantic Versioning to reduce package versioning nightmare and every dependency manager implements its own semantic versioner. Composer and NPM for example don't handle version constraints the same way. It's hard sometimes to be sure how some library version will behave against some constraint. This tiny webapp checks if a given version satisfies another given constraint.

Rather than give an employee a 2-hour window to do a job, have her do it right the first time (bonus points for documenting the process), then review and adjust your future plans based on time tracking data.
> * Improve systems : Improving systems helps remove busywork from an employee’s day, but it also makes things easier for the customer. 
> * Whether you’re getting a lot of satisfaction from being busy or just feeling exasperated, don’t forget to occasionally stop and ask yourself: Is this the best use of time?
