## Cat strengths
Cats like to enjoy the here and now. Living in the moment, they find it easy to adapt and change their plans.
They are popular team members but rarely push their views forward unless asked and like to be aware of people's strengths and beliefs.

## As children
Cats are strongest in music or art and crafts, and often like solitary activities. They also love the outdoors and see life packed with adventures and experiences to try out and enjoy.
Cats may sometimes need to be encouraged to ask for help when they need it, rather than always trying to find their own solution.

## As young people
They have an eye for quality and often have collections. They're often very close to their family and can feel nervous about leaving home. They're loyal friends, good at solving problems.

## As a friend
They're usually good fun to be with, though often like time on their own to recharge their batteries.

## As a boss
Caring, quiet, personal, democratic and flexible. Quite rare as leaders (because they are usually task-focused) and therefore can bring in original perspectives and approaches to their role. Tend to like and offer freedom and independence to their team members.

## Tips for Cats
Try finishing the important things before starting new projects.
