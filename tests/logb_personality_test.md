## Best score for B

### B = Beavers
Beavers have a strong need to do things right and by the book. In fact, they are the kind of people who actually read
instruction manuals. They are great at providing quality control in an office, and will provide quality control in any
situation or field that demands accuracy, such as accounting, engineering, etc. Because rules, consistency and high
standards are so important to beavers, they are often frustrated with others who do not share these same
characteristics. Their strong need for maintaining high (and oftentimes unrealistic) standards can short-circuit their
ability to express warmth in a relationship.
