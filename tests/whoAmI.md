### OUTLOOK
**Optimist** : High levels of extraversion combined with low neuroticism mean that optimists always look on the bright side of life. This doesn't mean that they don't experience troubles from time to time, but they don't let negative things get to them or bring their mood down. Your naturally sunny disposition means that you have plenty of other things to get excited about.

### CHARACTER
**Helpful** : Helpful people naturally want everyone around them to be happy and will actively work towards helping them achieve this. They are even prepared to work long and hard on difficult and thankless tasks until they're finished so others don't have to. You have a good amount of self discipline and are able to channel this toward benefitting others.

### SELF CONTROL
**Relaxed** : You may be very slow to anger, and reluctant to express it when it arises. As a result you may come across as too placid and seem like a bit of a pushover - but it's just that you'd much rather forgive and forget than harbour a grudge until it festers. You know that there are two sides to every situation.

### COMPOSURE
**Measured** : Measured people have a clear sense of their goals and what they need to do - and focus on - to achieve them. They tend not to be overly affected by external factors and take unexpected changes and opportunities in their stride. It's crucial to maintain a realistic sense of achievement so you don't let your ambitions run away with you.

### TASTE
**Pioneer** : You're interested in the new and different. Whatever it is, if you haven't experienced it before, you'll want to give it a try. People who share this characteristic also enjoy meeting people from different backgrounds, so thrive in big communal activities where they can learn about new places and perspectives.

### SOCIABILITY
**Giver** : People with this characteristic are naturally good-natured and extremely sociable. They are easy to get along with, which means they tend to be pretty popular with everyone they meet. If you recognise this trait in yourself, remember your old friends who have known you for a long time are just as important as those new buddies.

### ACTION
**Influential** : Influential people are productive, efficient and quick. They know what needs to be done and they're ready, willing and able to make it happen. Sometimes your determination might come across to other people as pushiness though, so it's important to know exactly where the line is between being influential and being domineering.

### ATTITUDE
**Progressive** : People with progressive attitudes tend to have a great deal of faith in human nature and believe in education, co-operation and free thinking as ways to help develop society. They are willing to try new ideas and solutions and take a thoughtful approach to issues like social problems. It sounds like you tend to be seen as the voice of reason in most situations.

### PROCESS
**Achiever** : Achievers have a real love of learning and very strong desire to do well. They combine impressive drive, high aspirations and a diligent approach to help them achieve their goals. They're also very adept at coming up with creative solutions to complex academic problems. If this sounds like you, remember to take some time to enjoy the ride - it can be as exciting as reaching the destination.

### RESILIENCE
**Engaged** : Engaged people tend to take life quite seriously, but are still able to see the funny side and laugh off difficulties when they arise. They're very adaptable, and don't view problems as things to stop them but as opportunities to inspire them to come up with creative solutions - and of course some humour.
