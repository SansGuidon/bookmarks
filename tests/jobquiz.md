Earning Potential: The Question of Money

An issue that you must consider when evaluating potential careers is money. It would be nice if we could all do only what we love, but the reality is that someone must be willing to pay for our efforts. Many people often complain about how much they get paid for doing a specific job. What they may fail to realize is that in a market economy income is highly predictable based on several market forces.


## The Income Triangle
Income is a factor of supply and demand and is primarily based on three elements:
1. How long does it take to develop a person capable of doing the job?
2. How scarce are the skills required to perform the job duties? (In other words, how much does the demand for these skills exceed the available supply?)
3. How much financial gain does the job produce for an employer or organization?

The three factors of income can be referred to as:
1. Development Time
2. Scarcity of Skills
3. Financial Productivity


If you rate each factor on a 1 – 10 scale (with 10 being highest), you can get an indicator of the amount of income that can be expected in that career. See the examples below:
Factor Surgeon Teacher Waiter
* Development Time 10 4 1
* Scarcity of Skills 10 4 1
* Financial Productivity 10 5 2
Total Points: 30 13 4

Average Income $365,915 $55,709 $19,250

Learning Point: As you consider your career, stay focused on the three legs of the income triangle. If you want a high income, you must be willing to spend considerable time developing skills that are scarce, in high demand in the market-place, and provide high levels of financial productivity to your employer. Without those things, you risk being left with a disappointing and undervalued career. Choose wisely!
