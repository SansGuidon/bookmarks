[D&D Online Alignment Test](https://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd%2Fdnd%2F20001222b) - Online Alignment Test

Your character has a unique view of the world, of right and wrong, of fairness and natural rights. This alignment test, taken from the Alignment chapter of the Hero Builder's Guidebook, helps you figure out how your character will relate to various moral and ethical choices in the game.

## D&D Online Alignment Test ##
Your Character’s Alignment

Based on your answers to the quiz, your character’s most likely alignment is **Neutral Good**.

### Neutral Good ###

A neutral good character does the best that a good person can do. He is devoted to helping others. He works with kings and magistrates but does not feel beholden to them. The common phrase for neutral good is "true good." Neutral good is the best alignment you can be because it means doing what is good without bias toward or against order.

--excerpted from the Player’s Handbook, Chapter 6

Keep in mind the alignment suggested by the quiz is just that: a suggestion. It describes your character no better than a 36-question test would describe you. But it’s a good way to start thinking about how your character acts when confronted with issues of alignment.

Now that your character has taken the test, make a note of which questions scored in the opposite direction from your overall alignment. These exceptions can tell some interesting tales about your character Are you a good character with a greedy streak? Are you a lawful character who can’t stand the village elders? Don’t just roleplay your alignment -- roleplay your alignment exceptions, too. Few characters perfectly embody their alignment choice.



### Changing Alignment ###

From time to time (say every three to five levels), it might be a good idea to retake this alignment test to see whether your character is experiencing "alignment drift." Perhaps you intended him to walk the straight and narrow, but (having fallen in with bad company), he’s becoming increasingly comfortable with behavior that would make his mentors blush. Or perhaps you intended her as a hard-bitten cynic, yet find that she’s the one who makes sure the rescued survivors get safely back to town, sometimes slipping them a few gold pieces to replace their losses.

Don’t despair: People change over time, and characters do too. Some become more lawful (there’s nothing like amassing a stockpile of loot to make you want banditry and thieving to stop). Others relax their earlier strictures to embrace a more flexible approach. The alignment you choose while creating the character may not be the alignment that best fits how you play that character. Retaking the test later on also has the advantage that, instead of abstract conditions, you can plug in specific examples of how the character behaved when faced with any of the situations outlined in the "test."

Note that some characters (paladins, clerics, monks) suffer consequences of shifting alignment. Consider this test a qualifying exam for beginning characters in this class ("Well, you seem to score poorly on lawfulness, Sir Eadgar -- are you sure you want to be a paladin?") and a moral and ethical compass for those already on their chosen path.
