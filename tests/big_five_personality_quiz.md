## Result (2020)

### YOUR BIG FIVE SCORES
* Openness to experience : 75 out of 100
* Agreeableness : 58 out of 100
* Conscientiousness : 67 out of 100
* Negative emotionality : 50 out of 100
* Extraversion : 42 out of 100

### OPENNESS TO EXPERIENCE
**75 out of 100**

**High openness to experience:** You’ve probably tried on several personal styles and hobbies during your life, and your curious brain is actively seeking new things to explore. Your identity may be flexible and open to change, but you’re likely to find success in careers that value that — the arts, for instance. Don’t trap yourself in a “Theater Kid” box, though. People with high openness also do well in careers that involve investigation and discovery. They might become scientists, lawyers or investigative journalists — basically weaponizing their intellectual curiosity and willingness to try new things and explore new ideas. Be aware, though, that dangerous drugs are among the things you’re more likely to be willing to try. Substance use disorders are a serious risk.

#### Your openness to experience subtraits
* Intellectual curiosity : 75 -> 100
* Creative imagination : 75
* Aesthetic sensitivity : < 75

### AGREEABLENESS
**58 out of 100**

**Moderate agreeableness:** You have to be pretty danged un-agreeable to truly count as a low agreeableness person. A lot of the outcomes that correlate with low agreeableness, like being chronically bullied (or bullying) or having a criminal record, don’t kick in until someone’s score is down in the 10th percentile. So even though all the Big Five traits operate on a spectrum — with the people in the middle tending to experience a little of what both poles feel to the extreme — the population of people who count as “moderately agreeable” is particularly large. (It’s just that some of you may have a little less tendency toward empathy, compassion and trust of your fellow human beings than others.) You’re no goody-goody, but you’re also not what the professionals might refer to as “a selfish jerk.”

#### Your agreeableness subtraits
* Compassion : < 75
* Respectfulness : < 75
* Trust : 50

### CONSCIENTIOUSNESS
**67 out of 100**

**High conscientiousness:** You are one of the organized, the responsible, the possibly just-a-wee-bit boring. The highly conscientious can be thought of as the carriers of tradition. They’re likely to be religious and join organized clubs like the Elks or the local bowling league. People like you work hard, and your boss probably loves your well-planned productivity. You’re likely politically conservative. And your sense of commitment and attention to the little details make you great to date and stable in marriage. If all of that fails to sell you to a potential partner, try this: Some research suggests that the spouses of highly conscientious people can end up with better health than they otherwise would have. Frankly, “hey, baby, I’ll increase your positive health outcomes” may well be the most “highly conscientious” pickup line imaginable.

#### Your conscientiousness subtraits
* Responsibility : 75 -> 100
* Organization : < 75
* Productiveness : 50

### NEGATIVE EMOTIONALITY
**50 out of 100**
**Moderate negative emotionality:** You don’t exactly have a propensity toward sadness, anger and anxiety. But you also aren’t exactly lacking those tendencies, either. All the Big Five traits operate on a spectrum — the people in the middle tend to experience a little of what both poles feel to the extreme. And that means you’re also likely getting a taste of the outcomes correlated with both those poles, too. People who score high on negative emotionality have rocky relationships — maybe you’ve had one relationship that brought that side out more than others. The low negative emotionality folks will cheerfully work the same job for decades with no burnout — maybe you take a little longer to reach burnout stage (even if you eventually do). If you’re reading this and thinking, “Hey, doesn't that just make me a normal human?” Well, statistically, yes, that would be how bell curves work, wouldn’t it? Don’t worry. There’s probably another personality trait where you’re more extreme.

#### Your negative emotionality subtraits
* Depression : 75
* Anxiety : < 75
* Emotional volatility : < 25

### EXTRAVERSION
**42 out of 100**

**Moderate extraversion:** In the Big Five, being an extravert is all about engagement with the world. That includes your interest in socializing, of course, but it’s also tied to your energy levels and ability to feel excited about other people and society at large. Because people who score in the middle of a trait tend to experience a little of what those on either pole feel, you’re likely getting a taste of the benefits afforded to the higher extraverts — popularity, a general sense of well-being — while also experiencing some of the drawbacks of relative introversion, such as a limited dating pool (at least compared with the real social butterflies). And that’s OK. Being in the middle ain’t so bad, really.

#### Your extraversion subtraits
* Energylevel : 50 -> 75
* Assertiveness : 50
* Sociability : < 25
