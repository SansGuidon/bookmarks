[BookBrowse](https://www.bookbrowse.com/quiz/) - Book lovers: What's your reading personality?

Result : 
**The All-Rounder**

Your responses showed you fitting equally into all four reading personalities:

**Involved Reader**: You don't just love to read books, you love to read about books. For you, half the fun of reading is the thrill of the chase - discovering new books and authors, and discussing your finds with others.

**Exacting Reader**: You love books but you rarely have as much time to read as you'd like - so you're very particular about the books you choose.

**Serial Reader**: Once you discover a favorite writer you tend to stick with him/her through thick and thin.

**Eclectic Reader**: You read for entertainment but also to expand your mind. You're open to new ideas and new writers, and are not wedded to a particular genre or limited range of authors.
