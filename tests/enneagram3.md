### Fives

Fives interact with the world by Striving to Be Detached. They are observant, logical, and generally reserved. They focus on problem solving, innovative ideas, and data gathering. When they overdo their Striving to Be Detached, they can end up being dull - out of touch with their experiences and emotions. When stresses, Fives may fear if they do not remain detached and guarded, they will become uncontrolled.

**Pitfalls for a Five** : Thinking too much, doing too little; not nuirturing relationships; unaware of surroundings and impact on others.
