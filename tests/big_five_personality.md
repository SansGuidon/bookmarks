### You Are **Low in Extraversion**
Your **score for Extraversion was low, at 33%.**

Extraversion describes a person’s inclination to seek stimulation from the outside world, especially in the form of attention from other people. Extraverts engage actively with others in order to earn friendship, admiration, power, status, excitement, and romance. Introverts tend to conserve their energy, and do not work as hard to earn these social rewards.

#### People who are low in Extraversion tend to be:

* Reserved
* Independent
* Quiet
* Deliberate

Extraversion seems to be related to the emotional payoff that a person gets from achieving a goal, especially a goal that involves other people. People who are high in Extraversion are thrilled by achievements like getting a promotion, landing a new mate, or receiving an award. People who are low in Extraversion do not experience the same “high” from these experiences, and so do not put in as much effort to pursue them.

People who are low in Extraversion tend to be fairly independent, and do not need a lot of admiration or recognition from others in order to feel satisfied. They tend not to be interested in money or status, and would rather lead a life that is personally pleasing than one that gains them the attention of others.

### You Are **Moderate in Agreeableness**
Your **score for Agreeableness was moderate, at 70%.**

Agreeableness describes a person’s tendency to put others’ needs ahead of their own, and to cooperate rather than compete with others. People who are high in Agreeableness experience a great deal of empathy and tend to get pleasure out of serving and taking care of others. They are usually trusting and forgiving.

People who are low in Agreeableness tend to experience less empathy and put their own concerns ahead of others. Low scorers are often described as hostile, competitive, and antagonistic. They tend to have more conflictual relationships and often fall out with people.

Your moderate score in Agreeableness indicates that you are fairly typical in the degree to which you balance your own interests with the interests of others. You are probably willing to sacrifice yourself for others some of the time, but you also watch out for yourself quite a bit.

### You Are **Low in Neuroticism** 
Your **score for neuroticism was low, at 28%.**

Neuroticism describes a person’s tendency to experience negative emotions, including fear, sadness, anxiety, guilt, and shame. While everyone experiences these emotions from time to time, people low in Neuroticism seem especially resistant to them.

* Carefree
* Optimistic
* Relaxed
* Self-Confident

Low Neuroticism scorers are less likely to get divorced or to suffer mental illness. They tend to handle stress well and take unfortunate events in stride. Major stressors like losing a job or getting a divorce are less likely to cause depression or anxiety in people who have low levels of Neuroticism. In general, low Neuroticism scorers report solid self-esteem and a positive outlook on life.
