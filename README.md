- I spend a lot of time on internet, losing myself in lot of topics. I choose GitHub to list my findings and bookmarks in a central location for productivity, to avoid losing my findings, and also to share them with the world.
- :warning: [**Full version**](https://github.com/MorganGeek/bookmarks/blob/master/README.md) :warning: I advise you to consult this very same page [here](https://github.com/MorganGeek/bookmarks/blob/master/README.md) for full content, as GitHub truncates files with a size over 500KB on main page, causing incomplete display of this list.

> - Collaboration that creates incoherence is easy. You all just do whatever you want. Equally, collaboration on things that are not complex is easy. You can all see whether the log has been chopped or not, there is limited room for debate.
> - On the other hand, lets say that instead we first come up with a clear overarching plan for what we’re doing. This makes it much more likely the outcome will be coherent. But the price we pay is having to handle the complexity of the entire challenge all at once.

> When dealing with build tools, a few things become apparent:
> * if you make the build tool simple, it won't handle all the weird edge cases that exist out there
> * if you want to handle the weird edge cases, you need to deviate from whatever norm you wanted to establish
> * if you want ease of use for common defaults, the rules for common defaults must be shared between the tool and the users, who shape their systems to fit the tool's expectations
> * if you allow configuration or scripting, you give the users a way to specify the rules that must be shared, so the tool fits their systems
> * if you want to keep the tool simple, you have to force your users to only play within the parameters that fit this simplicity
> * if your users' use cases don't map well to your simplicity, they will build shims around your tool to attain their objectives

> * There’s also a difference between asking questions and pushing back. Pushing back means you already think you know. Asking questions means you want to know. Ask more questions.
> * So next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a little bit before pushing back, before saying it’s too hard or it’s too much work. Those things may be true, but there may be another truth in there too: It may be worth it.

## Communication
* [Bohm Dialogue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohm_Dialogue) - (also known as Bohmian Dialogue or "Dialogue in the Spirit of David Bohm") is a freely flowing group conversation in which participants attempt to reach a common understanding, experiencing everyone's point of view fully, equally and nonjudgementally.[1] This can lead to new and deeper understanding. The purpose is to solve the communication crises that face society,[2] and indeed the whole of human nature and consciousness.

> - Get of all large meetings, unless you’re certain they are providing value to the whole audience, in which case keep them very short.
> - Also get rid of frequent meetings
> - Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren’t adding value.
> - Don’t use acronyms or nonsense words for objects
> - Communication should travel via the shortest path necessary to get the job done
> - A major source of issues is poor communication between depts. The way to solve this is allow free flow of information between all levels
> - If following a “company rule” is obviously ridiculous in a particular situation, such that it would make for a great Dilbert cartoon, then the rule should change.

> * Life is too short (really) to zoom past it.
> * People who survive (and grow) are the ones who stay in the moment, concentrate and strive to deliver their best.
> * Quality never comes from rushing through things.
> * Just because you can do so many things doesn’t mean you should attempt all of them.
> * Rushing too fast through these is a risk, it is a killer. You never savor the moment, be in the present and enjoy the process. You end up ‘doing’ so much that there is no time to ‘ruminate’

> 3. Identify the factors on your list of job negatives that you can change.
> 4. Create an action plan for changing the negative aspects of your job.
> 5. Educate yourself through training sessions or additional degrees to open up more opportunities at work.
> 6. Set your own goals at the office to give yourself something to work toward.
> 7. Participate actively in workplace decisions and communication when possible.
> 8. Set boundaries for work by only performing work duties at the office.
> 9. Remind yourself that you're fortunate to have a job in a tough economy. Refer to your list of positives about the job if you begin feeling negatively toward your work.
* [Nancy Lovering](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/productive-work-perfectionist-22559.html) - (2013) How to Be More Productive at Work if You're a Perfectionist
> 1. Measure progress instead of perfection. While quality is of utmost importance and should not be disregarded in favor of expedited task completion, finding a balance between getting it right and getting it done will allow you to be more productive.
> 2. Recognize how perfectionism can actually reduce the quality of your work when it leads to procrastination. A common pitfall of perfectionists, procrastination leaves you with inadequate project completion time to get the results you are truly capable of.
> 3. Stop comparing yourself to other employees. The urge to be competitive can enhance perfectionist tendencies.
> 4. Consider what the company requires from you, rather than what you want to see from yourself. Task completion is critical to business workflow, and what your inner perfectionist sees as substandard work may actually be within the acceptable range to meet business needs.
* [Shelley Frost](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/motivate-myself-work-11860.html) - (2012) How Do I Motivate Myself at Work?
> 1. Write down factors that drain your motivation. Create a plan to deal with each of the motivation roadblocks.
> 2. Identify your long-term career goals. Determine how your current job responsibilities will help you achieve those goals. Keep your future goals in mind to help you get through tasks you may not want to complete in your current position.
> 3. Start your day with a positive thought. Set one positive goal for the day to motivate you toward success.
> 4. Stop yourself when you begin with negative thoughts about your job. Reword the thoughts to turn them positive such as looking for alternative solutions rather than calling the current idea a failure.
> 5. Dress professionally as a motivational force. Buy new work clothes as an extra incentive to work hard in the office.
> 6. Reduce your stress levels to better deal with work tasks. Learn to breathe deeply and visualize success to keep stress levels in check.
> 7. Take care of your physical needs through regular exercise, a healthy diet and sufficient sleep. When you feel better physically, you are better able to tackle work duties and stay motivated.
> 8. Focus on your workplace successes. Look back at the professional moments that make you proud to motivate yourself to aim for further successful moments.
* [Allen Holub](https://holub.com/noaccountability/) - (2021) #NoAccountability. 
> * The notion of accountability—and its lesser cousin, responsibility—often pop up in the context of business, as if both of those ideas are good things. A culture of accountability, we’re told, is essential to running a business. I don’t buy any of it. A culture of accountability is actively destructive, and responsibility isn’t exactly positive, either.
> * Also, the notion elevates the individual over the team. To me, effective teams are collaborative, and that applies recursively. The notion of  “individual accountability” spits in the face of collaborative teamwork.
> * Accountability is all about external force. You are accountable to your boss, who will punish you if you don’t succeed. You are accountable to your team, which will somehow punish you if you “screw up.” Responsibility is not much better. It’s implies self shaming: You are responsible for X. You took on that responsibility voluntarily! You should be ashamed that you didn’t do it!
> * Both terms imply a culture of violence, to borrow a notion from Bob Marshall. Violence is not conducive to agility.
> * A healthy relationship is about collaboration and sharing, not power. The words “accountable” and “responsible” simply won’t come up in the context of dishes (or anything else) in a healthy relationship. The drivers are love and respect, not obligation.
> * At work, would you rather do a good job because you were responsible for something and held accountable when you fail, or because the work was gratifying and made you feel good?
* [Steve Scott](https://www.happierhuman.com/stop-being-cynical/) - (2020) How to Stop Being Cynical: 11 Proven Strategies
> 1. Admit to yourself that you are cynical.
> 2. Embrace positivity.
> 3. Practice gratitude.
> 4. Breathe : Cynical people often hold their breaths without evening noticing this automatic defensive response. Practice breathing techniques, such as yoga, to oxygenate you and relax your thoughts.
> 5. Be mindful.
> 6. Be playful, even for just five minutes every day : Allow yourself to play, be curious, have fun, and lose track of time for those five minutes. This may involve enjoying art or listening to some of your favorite songs. Or, it could mean participating in sports or spending time with some of your favorite people.
> 7. Limit your news consumption.
> 8. Reveal your true self.
> 9. Evaluate the company you keep : The people you spend time with influence your outlook. Examine the groups you follow on social media and the co-workers and other people you hang out with. Do they tend to be negative or positive?
> 10. Spend more time with positive people : According to Jim Rohn, we are the average of the five people with whom we spend the most time. Choose to be surrounded by people who exude optimism and positivity while maintaining a realistic outlook.
> 11. Look at people’s best qualities.
* [Thorin Klosowski](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-stop-being-a-cynical-asshole-1537302138) - (2014) How to Stop Being a Cynical Asshole
> * Cynicism is part of a defensive posture we take to protect ourselves. It's typically triggered when we feel hurt by or angry at something, and instead of dealing with those emotions directly, we allow them to fester and skew our outlook.
> * Another cause of cynicism is pretty simple: our brains are hard-wired to pay more attention to negative experiences. The more negativity we see in the world, the more likely we are to share that disposition with others. Over time, that tends to make us more cynical.
> * Once you acknowledge your problem, you can start faking a more positive attitude until it sticks. For example, Redditor LionLeo's shares his "fake it till you make it" success.
> * It just kind of came from more of a "go with the flow" attitude that I adopted overall and it's really made me a happier person. I used to deal with depression and anxiety and that's mostly gone away just because I adopted a positive attitude about things. Just try to be a little more enthusiastic about others (genuine or fake, just try it) and be interested in what they have to say.
> * Something I always keep in mind to keep me in check is a quote from Bill Nye, "Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't." When I think about it that way, people become more interesting to me.
> * For me, it's less about the flowery idea of concentrating on the positive and more about not focusing on the negative. If I have something constructive to say, I'll say it. If it's pessimistic vitriol, I try to keep it to myself.
> * Cynical assholes tend to surround themselves with other cynical assholes. It makes those long nights at the bar complaining about pop culture a lot more enjoyable. At some point, it's worth considering what impact these social relationships have on you.
> * Breed Your Curiosity : I've noticed that the less time I focus on my snarky, cynical responses, the more likely I'll have an actually useful idea. I also tend to pay more attention to the world around me and stop to appreciate the creativity of others.
> * Cynicism Isn't All Bad : The more we look at things critically with an emotional detachment, the more likely we'll be cynical about it. That's not always a bad thing, though. As Psychology Today points out, it's positive in small doses.
> * Though cynicism may not be healthy in the long run, it can serve as an emotional coat of armor that blunts life's everyday indignities.
> * Casting a cynical eye on situations you can't control reduces your emotional attachment to a particular outcome, says Yapko, and actually lowers your vulnerability to depression.
> * Cynics' propensity to spot setups and snow jobs before the rest of us also makes them socially valuable. Infamous cynic Maureen Dowd, for instance, did a Pulitzer-winning job of highlighting tragic flaws in the Clinton administration. "Cynics deserve more respect than they get," Bayan says. "You need naysayers who will shout down ideas that are extreme or just plain foolish."
* [Sarah Todd](https://qz.com/work/1790859/how-to-deal-with-cynical-coworkers/) - (2020) The secret to dealing with cynics at work
> * one way to break the cycle of cynicism and disrespect may be to help people feel more empowered.
> * the boss should also ask more about his professional goals. Perhaps he could suggest a conference the company could pay for him to attend, or a new project that he could head up
> * If you recognize some cynical tendencies within yourself, you might also keep an eye out for ways to empower yourself within your job. After all, the lesson is clear: Cynicism just doesn’t pay.

No, instead, it talks about cooperation.

> * You are moving too fast. Overwhelmed with everything, good or bad, happening around.
> * Life is too short (really) to zoom past it.
> * People who survive (and grow) are the ones who stay in the moment, concentrate and strive to deliver their best.
> * Quality never comes from rushing through things.
> * Just because you can do so many things doesn’t mean you should attempt all of them.
> * Rushing too fast through these is a risk, it is a killer. You never savor the moment, be in the present and enjoy the process. You end up ‘doing’ so much that there is no time to ‘ruminate’
* [Nancy Lovering](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/productive-work-perfectionist-22559.html) - (2013) How to Be More Productive at Work if You're a Perfectionist
> 1. Measure progress instead of perfection. While quality is of utmost importance and should not be disregarded in favor of expedited task completion, finding a balance between getting it right and getting it done will allow you to be more productive.
> 2. Recognize how perfectionism can actually reduce the quality of your work when it leads to procrastination. A common pitfall of perfectionists, procrastination leaves you with inadequate project completion time to get the results you are truly capable of.
> 3. Stop comparing yourself to other employees. The urge to be competitive can enhance perfectionist tendencies.
> 4. Consider what the company requires from you, rather than what you want to see from yourself. Task completion is critical to business workflow, and what your inner perfectionist sees as substandard work may actually be within the acceptable range to meet business needs.

> * Every 45 minutes, take 5 minutes. Stand, stretch, sip water, look out of a window at the horizon and ask what's really important at this moment?
> * Control what you can: your mood, where you place your attention (see 1) and the accessibility of distractions.
> * Sort out and invest in the home office. It’s permanent. 
> * Have a flight-deck: one place, one view, one perspective of what you need to focus on. This is not your in-box. Unsure? Read You, Only Better. 
> * Slow down enough that you can recognise the tantalisingly seductive but perspective destroying, energy depleting and soul withering nature of the blisteringly urgent, but actually not at all important.

> * Do a few things totally brilliantly every day. And feel very productive.
